                    <p class="information"><i>Windows 7</i>, also known as Blackcomb, was released in retail on October 22,2009. Windows 7 has a couple new features that separate it from
                     the last windows, 
                    <a href="windows-vista.html"><i>Windows Vista</i></a>. It has touchscreen, new designs, and support for virtual hard disks. Originally, <i>Windows 7</i>  was suppose to be 
                    what Vista was, but it now has better features and performance than ever before. It also has a new API for developers to code and create applications. With all these new features,
                   some were removed as well. Some taskbar features, the media player, photo gallery, calendar, were all remvoed, but instead, it is up on Microsoft's website for free download. On 
                    December 27,2008 the beta version was leaked onto the internet, and tests show that it is by far superior to Windows XP and Vista in many key areas. With these performances on hand, 
                    the required hardware was also needed to be much better. Minimum requirements include a RAM of 1 gigabyte, 16 gigabytes of storage, a 1 GHz IA-32 processor, and a DirectX 9 graphics card. 
                    <i>Windows 7</i> was received very well and was deemed a major improvement to Vista. On amazon, the pre orders of the computer in 8 hours had surpass the sales of <i>Windows Vista</i> in 
                    17 weeks. With every new windows, the demand of it increased exponentially. By March 2010, it as been sold over 90 million times. In June 2010, it has surpassed 150 million copies. 
                    This is also when Internet Explorer would start to fall out, as Windows contained download links to other web browsers. Its last release date is February 22. 2011.
