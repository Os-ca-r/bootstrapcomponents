                    <p class="information"><i>Windows 1</i> was released on November 6, 1985. This the first of windows history. It has a 16-bit interface meant for multi-tasking. However, as this 
                          is the first windows ever, its performance is terrible and there was not much you can do on it. There is 4 versions of <i>Windows 1</i>. 1.1 was released
                          1985, 1.2 in May 1986, 1.3 in August 1986, and 1.4 in April, 1987. As these versions came out, it became more compatible to more technology such as keyboards,
                          mouses, and printers. <i>Windows 1</i> started when Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft was shown a example, and learning about other tech companies advances,
                          decided to have windows their own thing. <i>Windows 1</i> started out with 2 floppy disk drives and it required 192KB of ram. This 16-bit computer came with a few programs
                          that are still around to this day. It came with .exe apps, such as <b>calculator</b>,<b>notepad</b>,<b> paint</b>, and <b>clock</b>. They use what is known as code 
                          segment swapping. This consists of three libraries, which are connected to files KERNEL.EXE, USER.EXE, and GDI.EXE. KERNEL.EXE 
                          is used for task and memory management. USER.EXE is used for the user interface, and "GDI.EXE" is used for the graphics of the computer. With these in mind,
                          the reviews of it were negative. Critics said that it was inferior to Apple's systems because of how slow it was and how 
                          incompatible it was when it was first launched. Poor performance, bad compatibility, hard to use and learn, made <i>Windows 1</i> stop receiving
                          updates on December 31, 2001.</p>
